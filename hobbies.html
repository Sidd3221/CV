    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Working with Technology: Ever since I was a child, 
				I have always enjoyed working with different forms of technology since we are pretty much surrounded by technology nowadays. 
				I'm also very interested in examining the details of how technology around us works.</li>
		 
			<li>Reading: I like to read because it has many benefits; one of which is increasing vocabulary. 
				Hence reading novels, online blogs, news articles and even relevant social media posts allows me to stay updated with the latest terminology.</li>
		 
			<li>Keeping myself physically and mentally fit: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a lack of physical and mental fitness has taken a serious toll on some people. 
				I like to keep myself physically and mentally fit to keep my mood and self-esteem elevated.
				I also like to motivate others to do the same.</li>
		 
			<li>Listening to music: I also like to keep up to date with the latest music that gets released. I like any song as long as it's catchy!</li>
		 
			<li>Playing video games: Gaming has always been one of my favourite past-times ever since I was a child. 
				I usually don't stick to one specific genre; as long as a game is fun and entertaining, 
				I will play it no matter which genre it is!</li>
		 
			<li>Volunteering: I always tend to lend a helping hand at local community events. 
				I believe that volunteering is the best way I can make a positive impact on my community.</li>
		 
			<li>Working with Cars: In addition to working with technology, I am also a huge car enthusiast. 
				In my spare time, I like to work as a DIY mechanic on cars and try to repair minor issues if there are any.
		   		I also hope to own some nice sports cars someday!</li>
